# ZombieConga-PM
Zombie Conga Unity-Playmaker-Source

Help the good zombie make a conga with the cats to dance with them. Watch out for the granny. 

This game is based on a tutorial by Chris LaPollo

It was completely rewritten and enhanced using Unity3D and Playmaker for my personal experience. Published for your enjoyment as is.
